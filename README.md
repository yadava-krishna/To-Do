Here's a sample project in React: a Simple To-Do List App. This app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, and filter the view to see all, active, or completed tasks. This project demonstrates basic React concepts, including component structure, hooks, and state management.

Project Structure
App.js: Main component to render the To-Do List.
TodoList.js: Component to manage and display tasks.
TodoItem.js: Component to represent individual tasks.

1. App.js
This will serve as the main application file, importing and rendering the TodoList component.
2. TodoList.js
This component will manage the state of the tasks and implement the main functionality of adding, deleting, and filtering tasks.
3. TodoItem.js
This component represents each individual task with options to mark it as complete or delete it.

Explanation of Components
App.js: The main component where we import and render TodoList.
TodoList.js:
useState:
tasks: Stores the list of tasks.
newTask: Holds the text for the new task to be added.
filter: Stores the current filter for tasks (all, active, or completed).
Functions:
addTask: Adds a new task to tasks.
toggleTaskCompletion: Toggles the completed state of a task.
deleteTask: Deletes a task based on its ID.
filteredTasks: Filters tasks based on the current filter.
TodoItem.js:
Props:
task: The task object containing text and completion status.
toggleTaskCompletion: A function to mark the task as completed or active.
deleteTask: A function to delete the task.
Step 3: Running the Project
Run the app using the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm start

How It Works
Add Task: Type a task in the input field and click "Add" to add it to the task list.
Complete Task: Check the box next to a task to mark it as complete, which will line-through the text.
Delete Task: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task.
Filter Tasks: Click "All," "Active," or "Completed" to filter the task list accordingly.
This app demonstrates key React concepts like managing component state, handling events, and passing data between parent and child components. Itâ€™s also a great way to learn about React's useState hook for state management.
